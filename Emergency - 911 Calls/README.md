  The dataset contains the 911 emergency calls which made throughout the time of year with reasons and addresses from where the incidents happened in different part of USA locations. The dataset used for data analysis and visualization of the reports based on different scenarios and use cases.

911 calls dataset available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert<br>

<br><p> I made some changes to the dataset to try to fix it with python, so I put some letters at the end of the values in the lat and lng columns, added some empty rows and columns. </p>

I have tried to utilise concepts of data science that I have learned to understand the scenario and bring insights.
